    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a method of clustering which allows one piece of data 
    to belong to two or more clusters, rather than belonging completely to just one cluster. 
    Thus, points on the edge of a cluster, may be in the cluster to a lesser degree than points 
    in the center of cluster.

    Here is an implementation in clojure.

    Lots more to come, but for now please see the sample code in fuzzy-cmeans.test.core
