# fuzzy-cmeans


## Overview
Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a method of clustering which allows one piece of data 
to belong to two or more clusters, rather than belonging completely to one cluster. 
Points on the edge of a cluster may be in the cluster to a lesser degree than points 
in the center of cluster.

Here is an implementation in clojure.

## Usage

Lots more to come, but for now please see the sample code in fuzzy-cmeans.test.core
